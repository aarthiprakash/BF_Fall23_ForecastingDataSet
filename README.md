2) A data dictionary has already been provided by the state and has been attached into this repository.
   
3) Data Collection Methodology: Each individual hospital and hospital system in California reports detailed facility-level data on services capacity, inpatient/outpatient utilization, patients, revenues, and expenses by type and payer, balance sheet, and income statement. The state collects and compiles this data into individual datasets every quarter.
   
4) This dataset intriques me because of my career interests. I would like to be in the healthcare sector for analytics purposes. Previously I have working on health insurance data for an analytics company. I hope to work in the healthcare space analyzing hospital data and be closer to the medical world from a technical and analytical capacity as well as my MBA interests in improving the US healthcare system.
